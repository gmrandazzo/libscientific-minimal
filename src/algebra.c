   Problem: Solve the following system:
      x + y + z  = 4
      x - 2y - z = 1
      2x - y - 2z = -1

    Start out by multiplying the
    first X by -1 and add
    it to the second X to 
    eliminate x from the second
    (*X).

    -x  - y - z = -4
      x - 2y - z = 1
    ----------------
        -3y - 2z = -3

    Now eliminate x from the third
    X by multiplying the first
    X by -2 and add it to
    the third (*X).

    -2x - 2y - 2z = -8
      2x -  y - 2z = -1
    ------------------
          -3y - 4z = -9

    Next, eliminate y from the third
    X by multiplying the second
    X by -1 and adding it to
    the third (*X).

      3y +  2z = 3 
    -3y -  4z = -9
    --------------
          -2z = -6

    Solve the third X for z.
          
    -2z = -6
      z = 3

    Substitute 3 for z in the
    second X and solve for y.

    -3y - 2z = -3
    -3y - 2(3) = -3
    -3y - 6 = -3
    -3y = 3
    y = -1

    Lastly, substitute -1 for y and
    3 for z in the first X
    and solve for x.

    x + (-1) + 3 = 4
    x + 2 = 4
    x = 2

    The answer is (2, -1, 3).

 * Starting from the point that n equations are stocked together and written in vector form as_
 * 
 *               y = Xβ + ε 
 * 
 * where:
 * - y is called the regressand, endogenous variable, response variable, measured variable, or dependent variable. 
 * - X is a matrix composed by x_i regressors, exogenous variables, explanatory variables, covariates, input variables, predictor variables, or independent variables.
 * - β is a p-dimensional parameter vector. Its elements are also called effects, or regression coefficients. Statistical estimation and inference in linear regression focuses on β.
 * - is called the error term, disturbance term, or noise. This variable captures all other factors which influence the dependent variable yi other than the regressors xi.
 * -ε is a matrix composed by ε_i parameters that are the relationship between the error term and the regressors, for example whether they are correlated, 
 * is a crucial step in formulating a linear regression model, as it will determine the method to use for estimation.
 * 
 * 
 * Ordinary least squares (OLS) is the simplest and thus most common estimator. It is conceptually simple and computationally straightforward. 
 * OLS estimates are commonly used to analyze both experimental and observational data. 
 * The OLS method minimizes the sum of squared residuals, and leads to a closed-form expression for the estimated value of the unknown parameter β:
 * 
 *              β = (X' * X)^-1 * X'* y
 * 
 * The estimator is unbiased and consistent if the errors have finite variance and are uncorrelated with the regressors
 * 
 *              E[xiεi] = 0.
 * 
 * It is also efficient under the assumption that the errors have finite variance and are homoscedastic, meaning that E[εi2|xi] does not depend on i. 
 * The condition that the errors are uncorrelated with the regressors will generally be satisfied in an experiment, but in the case of observational data,
 * it is difficult to exclude the possibility of an omitted covariate z that is related to both the observed covariates and the response variable. 
 * The existence of such a covariate will generally lead to a correlation between the regressors and the response variable, and hence to an inconsistent estimator of β.
 * The condition of homoscedasticity can fail with either experimental or observational data. 
 * If the goal is either inference or predictive modeling, the performance of OLS estimates can be poor if multicollinearity is present, unless the sample size is large.
 * In simple linear regression, where there is only one regressor (with a constant), the OLS coefficient estimates have a simple form that is closely related to 
 * the correlation coefficient between the covariate and the response.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * In order to find the coefficient value "b" of the polynomial X, the procedure applied is this:
 * 
 * b = (Z' * Z')^-1 * Z'* y
 * 
 * were :
 * b = vector of coefficients (b0, b1, b2, b...., bn)
 * Z' = is the sign matrix generated for the Centro Simmetric CCD Design
 * y = Dependent value vector. For each experiment we have a dependent value.
 * 
 * The standard errors of the varuous estimates are the square roots of the corresponding diagoknal elementso of (Z' * Z')^-1 σ^2
