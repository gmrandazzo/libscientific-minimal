 *  Variable Explanation
 * ----------------------
 *
 * xscores->row represent the number of objects that is equal to X_->m[i]->row;
 * xscores->col represent the number of pc that is less equal to X_->order and depends on the number of principal component computed
 *
 * xloadings->order represent the number of pc computed.
 * xloadings->m[i]->row represent the number of descriptor that is equal to X_->m[i]->col
 * xloadings->m[i]->col represent the number of order present in the tensor X_ and is equal to X_->order
 *
 * xvar is the variance explained for each component for the X matrix
 *
 * xcolaverage->row and xcolsdev->row are the number of variable for each submatrix in X_, so these are equal to X_->m[i]->col
 *
 * xcolaverage->col and xcolsdev->col are the number of order present in X_, so these are equal to X_->order
 *
 *
 * yscores->row represent the number of objects that is equal to X_->m[i]->row and Y_->m[i]->row;
 * yscores->col represent the number of pc that is less equal to X_->order and depends on the number of principal component computed
 *
 * yloadings->order represent the number of pc computed.
 * yloadings->m[i]->row represent the number of descriptor for each matrix in the tensor Y_->m[i]->col
 * yloadings->m[i]->col represent the number of order present in the tensor Y_->order
 *
 * yvar is the variance explained for each component for the Y matrix
 *
 *
 * ycolaverage->row and ycolsdev->row are the number of variable for each submatrix in Y_, so these are equal to Y_->m[i]->col
 *
 * ycolaverage->col and ycolsdev->col are the number of order present in Y_, so these are equal to Y_->order
 *
 * recalc_residuals & recalculated_y  have size row = number of objects  and col = number of column y * number of principal component and order is the same order of the Y dependent variable. Ex. if we calculate 5 component in 2 y the size will be 10
