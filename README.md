libscientific-minimal
=====================

This is a minimal version of libscientific that includes C only codes.
This version is designed to run on old computers that do not suppor fortran codes and exotic operative systems.

About
-----

Libscientific is a C framework  for multivariate and other statistical analysis.
It is purely writen in C language using their own numerical algorithms
for matrix computations. Only left eigenvectors and eigenvalues are calculated
using a third part library, lapack version 3.5.0.

Actually libscientific is able to compute:

  - Multivariate analysis
    - PCA (NIPALS ALGORITHM) [1]
    - PLS (NIPALS ALGORITHM) [1]
    - MLR (Ordinary least squares algorithm)
    - UPCA [2]
    - UPLS [2]

  - Cluster analysis
    - K-means++ (David Arthur modification) [3]
    - Hierarchical clustering

  - Object selection
    - Most Descriptive Compounds (MDC) [4]
    - Most Dissimilar Compounds  (DIS) [5]

Contributing
------------

To contribute you can fork the project, or if you have already forked the project
update to the latest version of libscientific, make the changes and open a Pull Request.

However some recommendations before open a Pull Request:
  * Be sure that your code it's working.
  * Comment your code with Parameters, Attribute, Return, Notes and References.
  * A test example is necessary.

Probably your code will be integrated but some quality controls and goals
have to be respected.
